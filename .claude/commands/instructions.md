I want to create a poc app that allows one to retrieve the users a user is following on farcaster.  farcaster is a web3 app which is similar to the X twitter platform.

The idea is the user connects with their address and then the app asks them if they are happy for the app to retrieve the people they are following.

The tech stack is React and TypeScript with vite and using material components from mui.com

I want to use reown for the user to connect with their wallet and retrieve the people they are following.  The users

I want to retrieve the max details of the people they are following including their wallet address, username, farcaster id, etc, if they are available.

For the purpose of this poc I want the users the user is following to be displayed on a web page.
