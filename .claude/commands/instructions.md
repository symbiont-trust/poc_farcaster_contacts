I want to create a poc app that allows one to retrieve the users a user is following on farcaster.  farcaster is a web3 app which is similar to the X twitter platform.

The idea with this poc app, is the user connects with their wallet address using the reown appkit wallet management library.  The app then asks them if they are happy for the app to retrieve the people they are following.

The tech stack is React and TypeScript with Vite and using material components from mui.com.  All web components should be material components.

I have metamask installed already in a chrome browser.

I want to retrieve the maximum details of the people they are following including their wallet address, username, farcaster id, etc.

I want the users the user is following rendered on a web page.

I have nvm installed which can choose the version of node.

I do not want you to automatically create a branch or commit code.

I am happy for you to use nvm and npm bash commands.

Before you create the code I would like you to provide a plan of what needs to be done.  Please save this plan in a file called plan.md in the .claude/commands directory of this project.  Then ask me to read the plan and ask if I want the plan carried out.
