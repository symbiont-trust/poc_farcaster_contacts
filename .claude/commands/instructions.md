I want to create a poc app that allows one to retrieve the users a user is following on farcaster.  farcaster is a web3 app which is similar to the X twitter platform.

The idea is the user connects with their wallet address and then the app asks them if they are happy for the app to retrieve the people they are following.

The tech stack is React and TypeScript with vite and using material components from mui.com

I want to use reown for the user to connect with their wallet and retrieve the people they are following.  I have metamask installed already in a chrome browser.

I want to retrieve the max details of the people they are following including their wallet address, username, farcaster id, etc, if they are available.

For the purpose of this poc I want to view the users the user is following on a web page.

I have nvm installed which can choose the version of node.

I do not want you to automatically create a branch or commit code.

I am happy for you to use nvm and npm bash commands.
